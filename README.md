# VirtualPiano



Abstract

Human Computer Interaction is becoming a major component in computer science related fields allowing humans to communicate with machines in very simple ways exploring new dimensions of research.We intend to develop a computer vision based virtual piano.

Introduction

We Intend to use the following hardware/technologies:
1. MATLAB Image Processing and Computer Vision toolbox
2. A USB camera.

The live camera feed from the camera will be divided into ROI and then algorithm will analyse if A particular piano key is pressed or not. When a particular key is pressed then corresponding musical frequency is played.
